Custom Drivetrain

Since my team had previously only built drivetrains with GoBilda channel, I thought it would be interesting in my senior year to create a custom drivetrain that would adapt better to the needs of this year's specific game. This involved designing and CADing plates that would encase the wheels, belts, odometry modules, and motors, which were then CNC-ed out of aluminum and carbon fiber.  This resulted in a drivetrain that was able to better fit our intake system, was able to drive over rail obstacles on the field, and was  narrower so it could navigate better on the field.
