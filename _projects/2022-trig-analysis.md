For our design project, my team decided to build a hand-held frisbee launcher, meant to allow people with broken fingers or limited hand mobility to play the game of frisbee.

The design includes a 3d-printed clip used to latch onto the frisbee. The clip is made up of 2 separate parts, a static top section meant to mesh with the topography of the top of the frisbee, and a bottom part which has holes for mounting 2 torsional springs, and a slot for a wire. The torsion springs are mounted at a 45 degree angle to provide grip onto the frisbee, and the wire is attached to a bike brake, such that when pulled it releases the frisbee from the clip. 

The rest of the design included an arm and a handle, to which a bike brake was attached. The bike brake was meant to provide better grip and was better suited for users with limited hand strength and mobility. The handle was designed to be inserted into a slot in the arm and bolted in place and a similar technique was used for connecting the clip to the arm.
